## âœ… Files Ready for Deployment

Your app is now ready to deploy! Here's what we've prepared:

### âœ… Backend Configuration

- `requirements.txt` - All dependencies listed
- `render.yaml` - Deployment configuration
- CSV data files in `specs/` folder included

### âœ… Frontend Integration  
- Frontend now served directly from Flask app
- API calls automatically use correct URLs (localhost for dev, production domain for deployed)
- All static files (JS/CSS) served by Flask

### âœ… Production Settings
- Debug mode disabled in production

- Environment variables configured

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Follow DEPLOYMENT.md)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up (free)
   - Create new Web Service from your GitHub repo
   - Set environment variable: `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY`

3. **Your app will be live at**: `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

## ðŸ”§ What Changed for Deployment

1. **Single-domain setup**: Frontend and API now served from same domain
