# Add Claude Command (Bootstrapping Command)

Create a structured Claude Code command based on my prompt. 

The command should:
1. Have a clear, descriptive name in the filename
2. Include a brief description of what the command does
3. Have step-by-step instructions that are specific and actionable
4. Follow the format and style of other commands in this directory
5. Be saved in the `.claude/commands/` directory with a `.md` extension

Ask me what kind of command I want to create and what it should do, then build it according to these specifications.
