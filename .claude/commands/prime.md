# Prime Command - Project Context Loading

READ and UNDERSTAND the README.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available. This will help you understand the project from the user's perspective.

RUN: git ls-files to understand the files in this project.

READ: ai_docs/claude_code_fresh_tutorials.md

THEN READ and UNDERSTAND all .md files in /specs folder. This gives the context for the project based on several different inputs. Some information may be contradictory; if you run into an issue, choose the simplest route and keep a note of how the item could be improved.

UPDATE the following files-
CLAUDE.md - if you believe there's anything unique about this project that should change how claude code functions.
README.md - Follow the existing structure to fill in the blanks as much as possible.
PLANNING.md - Write out a detailed step-by-step idea of how to build this project, from the init to the end result. Ultrathink, try very hard, take your time.
TASK.md - This is where you will record notes about what tasks have been accomplished, and what work is left to do, to the best of our knowledge. Keep a list of planned features and "stretch goals"

UPDATE the TASK.md file with each change that you make to the project. This is important, because it will give you context on future sessions. ONLY UPDATE if there are changes to the project, not just reading files.

UPDATE the PLANNING.md file if our changes have altered the information in that file.

DO NOT READ any files that are in the project's external/ directory. Those are files intended to be used elsewhere and either repeat information or would adversely affect your ability to understand the project.
