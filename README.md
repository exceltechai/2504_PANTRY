# Pantry & Commissary Recipe Recommendation System

A web-based intelligent recipe recommendation system that helps users find Whole30-compliant recipes by prioritizing ingredients from their available pantry (free) and commissary (reduced-cost) inventories before suggesting full-price supermarket purchases.

## Overview

This application solves the common problem of meal planning while trying to minimize food costs and waste. Users upload their available ingredient inventories from two sources - a pantry (free items) and a commissary (discounted items) - and the system intelligently recommends Whole30-compliant recipes that maximize the use of these available ingredients.

Key benefits:
- **Cost optimization**: Prioritizes free pantry items, then reduced-cost commissary items
- **Smart ingredient matching**: Uses fuzzy string matching to handle ingredient name variations
- **Whole30 compliance**: Filters recipes to maintain dietary adherence
- **Waste reduction**: Encourages use of available ingredients before purchasing new ones

## Quick Start

Get the recipe recommendation system running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2504_PANTRY.git
cd 2504_PANTRY

# Setup the project (install dependencies and create .env)
./setup.sh

# Start the application (backend + frontend)
./start.sh

# Access the application at http://localhost:8000
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the recipe recommendation system, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8+ (with pip)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Spoonacular API account (free tier available)
- 1GB free disk space for dependencies

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2504_PANTRY.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 2504_PANTRY
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Set up your environment for optimal performance:

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Create your environment configuration:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` with your API credentials:
     ```
     SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     FLASK_ENV=development
     FLASK_PORT=5000
     FRONTEND_PORT=8000
     FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD=80
     ```

2. **Spoonacular API Setup**
   - Register for a free account at [Spoonacular.com](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
   - Generate your API key from the dashboard
   - Add the key to your `.env` file

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Start the application and begin finding recipes:

```bash
# Start both backend and frontend servers
./start.sh

# Access the web interface at http://localhost:8000
# Upload your pantry.xlsx and commissary.xlsx files
# Search for recipes by type, cuisine, or ingredients
```

### Advanced Usage

For development and customization:

```bash
# Start only the backend server (API endpoints)
python src/app.py

# Start only the frontend server
python -m http.server 8000

# Run with custom fuzzy matching threshold
FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD=75 python src/app.py
```

### API Usage

Direct API access for integration with other applications:

```javascript
// Search for recipes
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/recipes?type=breakfast&cuisine=mediterranean')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(recipes => console.log(recipes));

// Upload inventory files
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('pantry', pantryFile);
formData.append('commissary', commissaryFile);
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/upload', { method: 'POST', body: formData });
```
