# Playwright Overview

Playwright is a modern end-to-end testing framework that enables reliable cross-browser automation for web applications.

## What is Playwright?

Playwright is a Node.js library and testing framework that provides a unified API to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. It's designed to handle modern web applications with features like single-page applications (SPAs), progressive web apps (PWAs), and complex user interactions.

## Key Features

### Cross-Browser Support
- **Chromium** (including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge)
- **Firefox**
- **WebKit** (Safari's engine)
- Mobile browser emulation
- True headless and headed modes

### Multi-Language Support
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (primary)
- **Python**
- **.NET**
- **Java**

### Advanced Automation Capabilities
- **Auto-waiting**: Automatically waits for elements to be actionable
- **Browser contexts**: Isolated environments for each test
- **Network interception**: Mock APIs and modify network requests
- **Mobile emulation**: Test responsive designs and PWAs
- **Shadow DOM support**: Handle complex web components
- **Multiple tabs/origins**: Test complex user scenarios

### Reliability Features
- **No trade-offs â€¢ No limits**: Designed to eliminate flaky tests
- **Trusted events**: Simulates actual user interactions
- **Out-of-process execution**: Browser runs in separate process
- **Automatic retrying assertions**: Built-in retry mechanism for assertions

## Installation

### Node.js/TypeScript
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

### Python
```bash
pip install pytest-playwright
playwright install
```

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: 20, 22, or 24
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 14+, Debian/Ubuntu
- **Storage**: ~1GB for browser binaries

## Core Concepts

### Browser Contexts
Each test runs in an isolated browser context, providing:
- Fresh cookies, local storage, and session storage
- Independent viewport and device emulation
- Separate authentication state
- Isolated network conditions

### Auto-Waiting
Playwright automatically waits for elements to be:
- Attached to DOM
- Visible
- Stable (not animating)
- Enabled
- Editable (for input actions)

### Locators
Playwright emphasizes user-facing locators:
- `getByRole()` - Accessibility-focused
- `getByText()` - Content-based
- `getByLabel()` - Form control labels
- `getByTestId()` - Test-specific attributes

## Development Tools

### Code Generation (Codegen)
```bash
npx playwright codegen [URL]
```
- Records user interactions
- Generates test code automatically
- Creates reliable locators
- Supports emulation options

### Test Inspector
- Interactive debugging
- Step-through test execution
- DOM exploration
- Action recording

### Trace Viewer
- Complete test execution timeline
- Network activity
- Screenshots and videos
- Action details and errors

### VS Code Extension
- Integrated test running
- Live debugging
- Code generation
- Test discovery

## Testing Philosophy

### Best Practices
1. **Test user-visible behavior** - Focus on what users experience
2. **Avoid testing implementation details** - Test the interface, not the code
3. **Keep tests isolated** - Each test should be independent
4. **Use semantic locators** - Prioritize accessibility-focused selectors
5. **Leverage auto-waiting** - Trust Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms

### Test Structure
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigation
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  // Interaction
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();
  
  // Assertion
  await expect(page.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Use Cases

### End-to-End Testing
- User journey validation
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Regression testing
- Integration testing

### Web Automation
- Data extraction/scraping
- Form automation
- Report generation
- Administrative tasks

### Performance Testing
- Network monitoring
- Resource loading analysis
- Rendering performance
- Core Web Vitals measurement

### API Testing
- REST API validation
- GraphQL testing
- Authentication flows
- Data validation

## Advantages Over Other Tools

### vs Selenium
- Faster execution
- More reliable element detection
- Built-in waiting mechanisms
- Modern JavaScript support

### vs Cypress
- True cross-browser testing
- Multiple tab/origin support
- Better CI/CD integration
- No test runner limitations

### vs Puppeteer
- Multi-browser support
- Built-in test framework
- Better debugging tools
- Enterprise features

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npx playwright test
```

### Docker Support
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-focal
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm ci
RUN npx playwright test
```

### Key CI Considerations
- Set workers to 1 for stability
- Use sharding for large test suites
- Configure proper timeouts
- Store test artifacts (videos, traces)

## When to Use Playwright

### Ideal For:
- Modern web applications
- Cross-browser testing requirements
- Complex user interactions
- CI/CD automation
- Teams prioritizing reliability

### Consider Alternatives When:
- Simple API-only testing
- Legacy browser support needed
- Very basic automation tasks
- Limited development resources
