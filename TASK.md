## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Backend Framework**: Flask (chosen for simplicity and flexibility)
- **Frontend Approach**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (avoiding framework complexity)
- **Matching Algorithm**: RapidFuzz (high performance fuzzy string matching)
- **API Provider**: Spoonacular (comprehensive recipe data with Whole30 filtering)
- **File Processing**: Pandas (robust Excel/CSV handling)

### Design Decisions Made
- **Color Coding**: Green (Pantry), Yellow (Commissary), Red (Store)
- **Matching Threshold**: 80% default (configurable)
- **Session Storage**: Temporary files (no persistent database for MVP)
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile experience

### Future Considerations
- **Database**: Consider PostgreSQL for user accounts and recipe caching
- **Frontend Framework**: React/Vue.js for advanced features
- **Authentication**: OAuth integration for user accounts
- **Deployment**: Cloud-native deployment with monitoring
